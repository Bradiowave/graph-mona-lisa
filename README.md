# Graph Mona Lisa

## How to Run Using Pipenv
1. On the root of the downloaded project, run `pipenv install` to install all dependencies.
2. Run `pipenv shell` to launch a shell in a virtual environment.
3. Run `python graph_demo.py` to create a graph with the defaults of 1000 vertices and 100 edges.
    * If that fails to work, try `python3 graph_demo.py` to force python3 to run.
4. To change the amount of vertices and edges, run `python graph_demo.py <num_vertices> <num_edges>`.
    * For example, `python graph_demo.py 10 5` would create a graph with 10 vertices and 5 edges.
5. Have fun!
